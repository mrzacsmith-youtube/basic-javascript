# Break Javascript in to bite size learning pieces

We will cover a lot of simple and more advanced Javascript concepts. Each lesson will have a corresponding YouTube video that will refernce the proper section here. There is not a system to the order of the lessons released, and if you have an idea for a topic, please drop a thread in my YouTube channel. 

I try to get each video to less than 8 mins, to allow for a quick learn! 

Each topic will have a folder and inside a template webpage that allows you to use the console, and the javascript file. 

## Video Topics:
